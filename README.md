# linegeneratorgui

A simple GUI for drawing abstract line drawings based on sine waves and bitwise operators with turtle. GUI exports to .svg file type, the .svg is then optimized for pen plotting.

test plot.jpg - a simple test, the plotter was not level so it has some errors, but that's why I like this stuff, it often glitches out in interesting ways.
